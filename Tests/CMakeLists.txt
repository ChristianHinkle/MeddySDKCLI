# Note that we do not "find package" for our parent project. We don't need to since we are built in the same
# cmake invocation as the it. That means we're being processed during the same configuration step as them, which
# means we'll have all their targets. Also, the targets that we reference in `target_link_libraries` commands don't
# even need to exist yet because CMake only validates the existence of targets at the end of the entire
# configuration process.
